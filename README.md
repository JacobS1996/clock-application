clock-application

# About

This is a simple application that I created using Windows Forms. It is just a clock that is precise to the second. I created this project in order to have another simple application to add to my portfolio and to continue practicing application development. While this project is very simple, I did have to gain some additional knowledge of User Controls in Windows Forms, Timers, and delegates from the Microsoft C# documenation as well as from other tutorials and forums. 

# How to Build

Ensure that you have Visual Studio (not Visual Studio Code) installed. On the GitHub repository, select the code drop-down button. Choose the option to open in Visual Studio. 

Once the repository is cloned to your machine, it should run from Visual Studio without any issues. If, after following these steps, the application will not build, please reach out to me via my GitHub contact information, and I try to resolve any issues and/or edit these instructions. 

# Contribution

This application was designed without the intention of having outside contribution. That being said, those who really wish to contribute to this application can do so by forking the repository, making changes on the development branch (or a newly created branch), and creating a pull request to merge those changes with the development branch on the original repo. 

This project is open-source and licensed under the MIT License. You are free to use this source code for your own purposes as long as you abide by the terms and condition of the license. 

# Roadmap

This application was developed for practice and demonstration purposes only and, as such, will likely not be improved upon in the future. That being said, the skills learned and applied during the development of this application may very well be used in future projects.
